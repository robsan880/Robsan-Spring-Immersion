# Lesson Plan: Introduction to AI and Ethics

## **Duration:**
45 minutes

## **Lesson Overview:**
This lesson introduces geniuses to the fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the importance of ethics in AI development. Geniuses will engage in a fun, interactive activity that demonstrates how AI systems learn and make decisions, emphasizing ethical considerations.

## **Objectives:**
- Understand the basic definition and applications of AI.
- Recognize the importance of ethics in AI development.
- Reflect on ethical dilemmas associated with AI technology.

## **Materials:**
- **Sticky notes** (enough for each genius)
- **Markers**
- **Whiteboard or projector**
- **"AI Scenarios" handout** (prepared in advance)

## **Standards:**
- Integrate knowledge of technology with ethical considerations.
- Develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills related to AI.

## **Lesson Activity:**

### 1. **Introduction (Time: 5 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Introduce AI and spark curiosity.
   - Begin by asking geniuses what they think AI is and where they've seen it.
   - play 2 short Spot the AI Games.

### 2. **Direct Instruction (Time: 10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Provide foundational knowledge about AI and ethics.
   - Present a brief slideshow defining AI and its various applications.
   - Introduce the concept of ethics in AI, highlighting real-world examples where ethics play a crucial role.

### 3. **Guided Practice (Time: 15 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Engage students in an activity to illustrate AI learning and ethical decision-making.
   - **Activity:** "The AI Ethics Relay"
     - Divide geniuses into small groups.
     - Each group receives an "AI Scenario" handout describing an AI system facing an ethical dilemma.
     - Groups discuss and decide how the AI should act, considering ethical implications.
     - Each group writes their decision on sticky notes.
     - Groups rotate and review other groups' decisions, adding their thoughts.

### 4. **Independent Practice (Time: 10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Encourage individual reflection on AI ethics.
   - geniuses write a brief journal entry on google classroom on how they would feel if they were affected by the AI's decision in the scenario.
   - They consider questions like: Was the AI's decision fair? What could be the consequences?

### 5. **Closure (Time: 5 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Summarize key takeaways and prepare for the next lesson.
   - Discuss common themes from the group activity.
   - Emphasize the responsibility of developing ethical AI.
   - Preview the next lesson on how AI systems learn from data.

## **Assessment:**
- Participation in group discussions and activities.
- Review of geniuses' written reflections for understanding of ethical considerations.

## **Extra Activities:**
- geniuses who finish early can research a recent news article about AI ethics and share their findings with the class in the next lesson.

## **Reflection / Takeaways:**
- The group activity successfully engaged geniuses and prompted deep thinking about ethics.
- For improvement, provide more diverse scenarios to cover a broader range of ethical issues.
