# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Python for AI Chatbots

## **Duration:**
45 minutes

## **Lesson Overview:**
Geniuses will be introduced to Python programming basics, focusing on concepts relevant to building an AI chatbot. They'll participate in an interactive coding activity that demystifies programming and prepares them for the final project.

## **Objectives:**
- Learn basic Python syntax and structures.
- Understand how Python can be used to create AI applications.
- Write simple Python code relevant to chatbot functions.

## **Materials:**
- **Computers with VSCode**
- **Projector for live coding demonstration**
- **Sample code snippets**

## **Standards:**
- Apply programming concepts to develop technological solutions.
- Enhance computational thinking and coding skills.

## **Lesson Activity:**

### 1. **Introduction (Time: 5 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Introduce Python and its role in AI.
   - Discuss why Python is popular in AI development.
   - Show examples of Python in action (e.g., simple scripts).

### 2. **Direct Instruction (Time: 10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Teach basic Python concepts.
   - Cover variables, data types, input/output, and simple conditionals.
   - Live code simple examples and explain each step.

### 3. **Guided Practice (Time: 20 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Practice writing Python code.
   - **Activity:** "Build a Simple Conversational Script"
     - Geniuses write a Python program that asks the user for their name and responds with a greeting.
     - Extend the program to ask additional questions and respond based on input.
     - Circulate to help geniuses troubleshoot and understand errors.

### 4. **Independent Practice (Time: 5 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Enhance their script individually.
   - Geniuses add at least one more interaction to their program.
   - Encourage creativity in responses.

### 5. **Closure (Time: 5 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Recap key programming concepts.
   - Discuss how these basics are fundamental to building a chatbot.
   - Set excitement for the next lesson where they'll create a basic AI chatbot.

## **Assessment:**
- Review Geniuses code for correct syntax and functionality.
- Observe problem-solving approaches during coding.

## **Extra Activities:**
- Geniuses who advance quickly can experiment with more complex data structures like lists.

## **Reflection / Takeaways:**
- Hands-on coding boosted confidence.
- Plan to allocate more time for troubleshooting in future sessions.

## Resources:
- Basic Varible app
```
  a, b = 0, 1
while b < 10:
    print(b)
    a, b = a, a + b
```
