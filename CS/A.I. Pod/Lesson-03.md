# Lesson Plan: Hands-On with Supervised Learning Algorithms

## **Duration:**
45 minutes

## **Lesson Overview:**
Geniuses will simulate a supervised learning algorithm through a group activity that involves making predictions based on training data, reinforcing their understanding of how AI models learn and generalize.

## **Objectives:**
- Experience the process of training and testing in supervised learning.
- Understand overfitting and the importance of diverse training data.
- Apply supervised learning concepts to make predictions.

## **Materials:**
- **Decks of playing cards**
- **Score sheets**
- **Whiteboard for recording results**

## **Standards:**
- Apply mathematical reasoning to tech concepts.
- Develop problem-solving strategies in group settings.

## **Lesson Activity:**

### 1. **Introduction (Time: 5 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Connect supervised learning to predictive modeling.
   - Briefly discuss how AI models make predictions after training.
   - Introduce the day's activity simulating this process.

### 2. **Direct Instruction (Time: 5 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Explain the activity's rules and goals.
   - Describe how geniuses will use card patterns to predict outcomes.
   - Emphasize the learning phase (training) and prediction phase (testing).

### 3. **Guided Practice (Time: 25 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Engage in the supervised learning simulation.
   - **Activity:** "Predict the Card"
     - Divide geniuses into small groups.
     - Each group receives a deck of cards (training data).
     - Groups analyze patterns (e.g., suit, number sequences) and note observations.
     - After training, the educator presents new cards (test data), and groups predict the next card based on learned patterns.
     - Record predictions and compare with actual outcomes.

### 4. **Independent Practice (Time: 5 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Reflect on the prediction process and results.
   - Geniuses write about the strategies used and their effectiveness.
   - Consider what they could do differently to improve accuracy.

### 5. **Closure (Time: 5 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Summarize insights and prepare for AI chatbot building.
   - Discuss how AI models can overfit or underfit based on training data.
   - Highlight the importance of good training data for AI applications.

## **Assessment:**
- Evaluate group participation and strategies used.
- Review reflections to assess understanding of supervised learning principles.

## **Extra Activities:**
- Encourage advanced geniuses to alter the patterns intentionally to test robustness.

## **Reflection / Takeaways:**
- The competitive element increased engagement.
- Next time, debrief more thoroughly on overfitting and its implications.
