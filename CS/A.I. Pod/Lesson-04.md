# Lesson Plan: Exploring Prompt Engineering

## **Duration:**
45 minutes

## **Lesson Overview:**
Geniuses will learn about prompt engineering and how it influences AI responses. They'll engage in an activity crafting prompts to elicit desired outputs from AI, highlighting the importance of clear communication.

## **Objectives:**
- Understand what prompt engineering is in the context of AI.
- Learn how different prompts can change AI outputs.
- Develop skills in creating effective prompts.

## **Materials:**
- **Index cards**
- **Pens**
- **Example AI responses** (printed or projected)
- **Access to an AI language model (ChatGPT)**

## **Standards:**
- Apply language and communication skills in technology.
- Foster critical thinking in creating effective instructions.

## **Lesson Activity:**

### 1. **Introduction (Time: 5 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Introduce prompt engineering.
   - Ask geniuses about their experiences with voice assistants or chatbots.
   - Explain how the way we ask questions affects the answers we receive.

### 2. **Direct Instruction (Time: 10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Demonstrate the impact of prompts on AI responses.
   - Show examples of different prompts and resulting outputs.
   - Play ISpy with ChatGPT (Tell ChatGPT in Prompt you want to play ISpy)
   - Discuss tips for crafting clear and precise prompts.

### 3. **Guided Practice (Time: 20 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Practice creating and refining prompts.
   - **Activity:** "Prompt Crafting Challenge"
     - Geniuses choose a topic of interest.
     - Write an initial prompt on an index card.
     - Exchange cards with a partner to critique and improve the prompt.
     - Optionally, input prompts into an AI model to see actual responses (if available).

### 4. **Independent Practice (Time: 5 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Reflect on the prompt engineering process.
   - Geniuses note what changes made their prompts more effective.
   - Consider how this applies to interacting with AI systems.

### 5. **Closure (Time: 5 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Summarize learning and link to future lessons.
   - Discuss how prompt engineering is crucial for controlling AI outputs.
   - Prepare Geniuses for applying these skills in AI chatbot development.

## **Assessment:**
- Review prompts created by Geniuses for clarity and effectiveness.
- Observation of peer feedback during the activity.

## **Extra Activities:**
- Encourage Geniuses to experiment with prompts at home using available AI tools.

## **Reflection / Takeaways:**
- Geniuses enjoyed creating prompts on topics they care about.
- Next time, incorporate more examples of effective prompts in different contexts.
