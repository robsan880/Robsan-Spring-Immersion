# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Supervised Learning

## **Duration:**
45 minutes

## **Lesson Overview:**
Geniuses will delve into supervised learning, understanding how labeled data guides AI algorithms. They'll participate in a creative activity that demonstrates the importance of data labeling in machine learning.

## **Objectives:**
- Define supervised learning and its role in AI.
- Recognize the significance of labeled data in training models.
- Experience supervised learning through an interactive exercise.

## **Materials:**
- **Blindfolds or Equavilent** (enough for half the class)
- **Assorted items with distinct characteristics**
- **Labels/tags for items**
- **Whiteboard and markers**

## **Standards:**
- Understand and apply concepts of supervised learning.
- Enhance collaborative skills through group activities.

## **Lesson Activity:**

### 1. **Introduction (Time: 5 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Connect previous lessons to supervised learning.
   - Recap classification activity.
   - Introduce supervised learning as a way AI models learn from labeled data.

### 2. **Direct Instruction (Time: 10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Explain supervised learning concepts.
   - Play Supervised Learning Version of Art Bot.
   - Discuss examples such as image recognition and language translation.

### 3. **Guided Practice (Time: 20 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Participate in a supervised learning simulation.
   - **Activity:** "Blindfolded Data Labeling"
     - Pair geniuses; one is the "AI model" (blindfolded), the other is the "Trainer."
     - "Trainer" presents items to the "AI model," describing them and stating their labels.
     - After several items, the "AI model" tries to guess new items based on prior information.
     - Rotate roles to allow practice.

### 4. **Independent Practice (Time: 5 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Personal reflection on the learning process.
   - Geniuses write about in Google Classroom how the blindfolded experience relates to AI learning from data.
   - Consider the difficulties faced without visual input.

### 5. **Closure (Time: 5 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Reinforce key ideas and set the stage for prompt engineering.
   - Summarize how labeled data trains AI models.
   - Introduce the concept of prompt engineering for the next lesson.

## **Assessment:**
- Participation in the activity.
- Reflection writings to gauge understanding of supervised learning.

## **Extra Activities:**
- Challenge geniuses to think of data that could be mislabeled and its impact on AI.

## **Reflection / Takeaways:**
- The activity effectively illustrated the dependence on labeled data.
- For improvement, discuss real-world consequences of incorrect data labeling.
