# Lesson Plan: Deep Dive into Classification with Scenario Role-Playing

## **Duration:**
45 minutes

## **Lesson Overview:**
Building on previous lessons, geniuses will deepen their understanding of classification algorithms through a scenario-based role-playing activity that illustrates how AI distinguishes between categories based on features.

## **Objectives:**
- Grasp how classification algorithms use features to categorize data.
- Identify key features that differentiate classes.
- Apply critical thinking to model classification through role-play.

## **Materials:**
- **Scenario cards with different roles (e.g., hospital patients, restaurant customers)**
- **Feature tags (e.g., "Age," "Symptoms," "Order Preferences")**
- **Whiteboard and markers**
- **Role-play instructions and worksheets**

## **Standards:**
- Use modeling to solve problems.
- Engage in collaborative problem-solving activities.

## **Lesson Activity:**

### 1. **Introduction (Time: 5 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Refresh prior knowledge on classification.
   - Quick review of previous classification activity.
   - Introduce the concept of feature selection in classification.

### 2. **Direct Instruction (Time: 10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Explain how algorithms select and use features.
   - Discuss features as attributes that aid in differentiating data.
   - Provide examples of features in various datasets.

### 3. **Guided Practice (Time: 20 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Model classification through role-play.
   - **Activity:** "Role-Play Classification"
     - Distribute scenario cards to geniuses, each with a specific role.
     - Assign feature tags to students based on their scenarios (e.g., "Patient with Flu," "Customer ordering Vegan Meal").
     - Create groups that classify themselves based on shared features (e.g., symptoms, preferences).
     - Introduce complexity by overlapping features and encourage geniuses to reclassify when new information is added.

### 4. **Independent Practice (Time: 5 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Solidify understanding through individual reflection.
   - Geniuses write down in Google Classroom insights from role-play, including challenges in classification.
   - Reflect on how misclassification could occur and its potential impact.

### 5. **Closure (Time: 5 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Highlight key learnings and transition to AI chatbot development.
   - Summarize how features impact classification accuracy.
   - Explain how these concepts will be applied in building AI applications.

## **Assessment:**
- Observation during the role-play activity.
- Review written reflections for understanding of feature importance.

## **Extra Activities:**
- Challenge Geniuses to create their own scenarios and suggest features for classification.

## **Reflection / Takeaways:**
- The dynamic nature of role-play helped students understand complex ideas.
- Next time, adjust scenarios to reflect a wider range of real-world applications.
