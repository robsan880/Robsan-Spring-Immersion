# Lesson Plan: Understanding Machine Learning and Classification

## **Duration:**
45 minutes

## **Lesson Overview:**
Geniuses will explore the basics of machine learning, focusing on classification. They'll participate in an interactive game that simulates how AI classifies data, reinforcing their understanding through physical activity.

## **Objectives:**
- Comprehend the concept of machine learning and how AI learns from data.
- Understand classification as a fundamental machine learning task.
- Experience the challenges of classification through an engaging activity.

## **Materials:**
- **A variety of objects** (e.g., balls, blocks, markers, pens) with different attributes
- **Labels or tags**
- **Whiteboard**
- **Projector for demonstration slides**

## **Standards:**
- Apply knowledge of technology to model and solve problems.
- Develop teamwork and communication skills through collaborative activities.

## **Lesson Activity:**

### 1. **Introduction (Time: 5 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Recap previous lesson and introduce machine learning.
   - Briefly revisit AI concepts and ethics discussed earlier.
   - Introduce machine learning as a method for AI to learn from data.

### 2. **Direct Instruction (Time: 10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Explain machine learning and classification.
   - Use ART Bot game to breaifly describe machine learning. Start new game.
   - Define classification and provide real-life examples (e.g., email spam filters).

### 3. **Guided Practice (Time: 20 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Engage geniuses in a hands-on classification activity.
   - **Activity:** "Human Machine Learning Classifier"
     - Spread objects on a table.
     - Divide geniuses into two teams: "Data Points" and "Classifiers."
     - "Data Points" pick an object and describe its features (color, size, shape) without showing it.
     - "Classifiers" attempt to guess the object or categorize it based on the description.
     - Switch roles to allow all geniuses to participate.

### 4. **Independent Practice (Time: 5 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Reflect on the activity and solidify understanding.
   - Geniuses write down in Google Classroom what strategies helped in classifying the objects.
   - Consider what challenges they faced and how this relates to AI classification.

### 5. **Closure (Time: 5 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Summarize key concepts and link to upcoming lessons.
   - Discuss how the activity mirrors AI classification processes.
   - Preview the next lesson on supervised learning and data labeling.

## **Assessment:**
- Observations during the activity to assess participation and understanding.
- Review written reflections for insights into their grasp of classification.

## **Extra Activities:**
- Geniusess brainstorm other applications of classification in technology and share next class.

## **Reflection / Takeaways:**
- The physical activity energized the class and made abstract concepts tangible.
- Next time, incorporate more complex objects to increase difficulty.
